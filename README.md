# Community Knowledge Profiles
Refresh of [Community Knowledge Profiles](https://www.sheffield.gov.uk/your-city-council/community-knowledge-profiles) to include [Census 2021 data](https://www.ons.gov.uk/census).  

Tasks are identified, assigned, and maintained via the project Kanban board [@ckp-kanban](https://github.com/orgs/scc-pi/projects/2). 

## RAP  

We will look to apply [RAP (Reproducible Analytical Pipeline) principles](https://nhsdigital.github.io/rap-community-of-practice/introduction_to_RAP/levels_of_RAP/#baseline-rap-getting-the-fundamentals-right). This includes:  

* Data is handled and output in a [Tidy data format](https://medium.com/analytics-vidhya/untidy-data-a90b6e3ebe4c).  
* Code adheres to agreed coding standards (e.g [The tidyverse style guide](https://style.tidyverse.org/) for R).
