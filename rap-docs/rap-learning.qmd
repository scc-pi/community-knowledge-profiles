# Introduction

This document will capture the RAP (Reproducible Analytical Pipeline) learning from the CKP (Community Knowledge Profile) project.  

The project has several factors that make it suitable for understanding RAP better:  

1. The data is open source, so data security considerations aren't paramount.  
2. The project involves multiple data analysts.  
3. The pipeline is not particularly complex.  

The expectation that the notes in this document will mature and reside outside a pipeline specific repo and in a Council resource, such as [pinsheff](https://scc-pi.github.io/pinsheff/), a [Methods Manual](https://scc-pi.github.io/methods-manual/), or something like [Hackney's Data Platform Playbook](https://playbook.hackney.gov.uk/Data-Platform-Playbook/).
