# Introduction

This document will capture the RAP (Reproducible Analytical Pipeline) learning from the CKP (Community Knowledge Profile) project.  

The project has several factors that make it suitable for understanding RAP better:  

1. The data is open source, so data security considerations aren't paramount.  
2. The project involves collaboration between data analysts.  
3. The pipeline is not particularly complex.  

The expectation is that the notes in this document will mature and reside outside a pipeline specific repo and in a Council-wide resource such as [pinsheff](https://scc-pi.github.io/pinsheff/), a [Methods Manual](https://scc-pi.github.io/methods-manual/), or something like [Hackney's Data Platform Playbook](https://playbook.hackney.gov.uk/Data-Platform-Playbook/). 

## Setup  

Load packages and declare functions.

```{r}
#| label: setup

library(renv)
library(tidyverse)
library(tools)
library(jsonlite)
library(janitor)
library(kableExtra)
library(here)

# Output & format a data frame as a table
table_style <- function(df, scroll_box = TRUE) {
  df |> 
    kbl(format.args = list(big.mark = ",")) |> 
    kable_styling(
      bootstrap_options = "striped",
      full_width = F,
      font_size = 12,
      position = "left"
    ) |>
    (\(.) if(scroll_box) scroll_box(., height = "400px") else .)()
}
```

# Packaging  

A requirement of the [NHS Gold RAP - analysis as a product](https://nhsdigital.github.io/rap-community-of-practice/introduction_to_RAP/levels_of_RAP/#the-levels-of-rap-maturity-framework) is:  

> Code is fully [packaged](https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/).

The Government's Analytical Services guidance includes the following [RAP Principle](https://analysisfunction.civilservice.gov.uk/policy-store/reproducible-analytical-pipelines-strategy/#section-12):  

> Packaging.

## Templates

We first looked at the repository template:  
[github.com/craig-shenton/rapR-package-template](https://github.com/craig-shenton/rapR-package-template)  

However, this was too complex for a simple project that already involved learning for contributors around ggplot, version control etc.  

Instead, we used [create_package()](https://usethis.r-lib.org/reference/create_package.html) function from the `usethis` R package and ran:  
`usethis::create_package(here::here(), check_name = FALSE)`

# Containers  

Our motivation was to create a GitHub Codespace, or something like it, for the project. To allow the project to be used by anyone interested in starting to use R and contribute to the work. To pass them a URL that opened a development environment in their browser, with everything setup and ready for them to code. We haven't succeeded in this yet, but the notes in this section include some useful reproducibility lessons.  

The code in the CKP repo may not work in a year's time if a new version of R introduces breaking changes. It might not work if some of the packages that the code in the repo depends on evolve and introduce some breaking changes. Similarly, if you're collaborating on a project, a colleague may have different versions of the packages or R, and consequently you may get different results from the same code. 

There are different ways of improving the reproducibility of code by specifying the dependencies (including versions) of what the code runs on. Containers is one option, an option that can also make other aspects easier, such as maintaining development environments, peer review, testing, deploying to the cloud for more computing power, and deploying to production.  

One of the requirements of the [NHS Silver RAP Maturity Level - implementing best practice](https://nhsdigital.github.io/rap-community-of-practice/introduction_to_RAP/levels_of_RAP/#the-levels-of-rap-maturity-framework) is:  

> Repository includes dependency information (e.g. [requirements.txt](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/user_guide/#requirements-files), [PipFile](https://github.com/pypa/pipfile/blob/main/README.rst), [environment.yml](https://nhsdigital.github.io/rap-community-of-practice/training_resources/python/virtual-environments/conda/)).

Another option for R is [renv](https://rstudio.github.io/renv/articles/renv.html).

The Government's Analytical Services guidance includes the following [RAP Principle](https://analysisfunction.civilservice.gov.uk/policy-store/reproducible-analytical-pipelines-strategy/#section-12):  

> Dependency management.

And, the following [Reproducible Analysis Platform](https://analysisfunction.civilservice.gov.uk/policy-store/reproducible-analytical-pipelines-strategy/#section-13):  

> Reproducible infrastructure and containers, for example, [docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/overview/).

## Codespaces  

Our CKP project is hosted in a public GitHub repo, so our preferred option would be [GitHub Codespaces](https://docs.github.com/en/codespaces).  

Codespaces does integrate with IDE's other than VS Code. However, the example from David Smith at the 2022 RStudio Conference, only manages this via a VS Code port. We were able to replicate this for the [community-knowledge-profiles](https://github.com/scc-pi/community-knowledge-profiles) repo by simply copying the `.devcontainer` directory from David's example. This proved neither slick nor robust to changes, and as there's a Posit Cloud option we didn't spend long trying to improve this.

## Posit Cloud & renv

You can login to [https://posit.cloud](https://posit.cloud/) (formerly RStudio Cloud) using your GitHub account, which makes working with GitHub repos easier.  

To setup Posit Cloud for CKP: 

1. Create a *New Project* > *New Project from Git Repository*.  

    ![](../resources/new-project.png)

2. Add the HTTPS URL for our repo.  

    `https://github.com/scc-pi/community-knowledge-profiles.git`

3. From the RStudio terminal call `renv::restore()`. This will install the necessary packages into your Posit Cloud RStudio project. It can take twenty or thirty minutes, but only for the first time as part of setting up the project.  

4. Setup your GitHub PAT for HTTPS as per Jenny Bryan's instructions.  

    [https://happygitwithr.com/https-pat.html#tldr](https://happygitwithr.com/https-pat.html#tldr)  

This process isn't as slick as we'd like for people new to R. Ideally we'd authorise their use of a cloud based development environment for the project and pass them a URL. You can't really do this with Posit Cloud without paying. 

You can [share and collaborate](https://posit.cloud/learn/guide#collaborate) within a Posit Cloud Space. However, the time spent by others in a project you created is registered against your time. You only have 25 hours a month on the [Posit Cloud free plan](https://posit.cloud/plans), so best to save this for code reviews etc.   

This Posit Cloud setup makes use of the {renv} R package which handles project level package management, as opposed to the normal system or user level package management. We made use of the following renv guidance in particular:  

* [Workflow](https://rstudio.github.io/renv/articles/renv.html#workflow)
* [Collaborating](https://rstudio.github.io/renv/articles/collaborating.html)

If you add or remove packages from the CKP project (in a repo on your laptop or in Posit Cloud) you need to update the `renv.lock` file by calling `renv::snapshot()`. Then stage, commit, and push your `renv.lock` change to the CKP repo. If a change to `renv.lock` is pulled, you need to call `renv::restore()` to install or remove the packages.    

{renv} also integrates with RStudio Packages pane:  

![](../resources/renv-rstudio.png)

See @sec-explore-renv for a deeper look at {renv} and our project dependencies.

## Docker

*TODO*

?? [Rocker](https://rocker-project.org/)

?? Development Environments preview

## Dev Box

[Microsoft Dev Box](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-ca/products/dev-box/) is an interesting option that could fit well with our projects that use PID and have repos on Azure DevOps.

## Render RAP Learning Quarto

To render the RAP Learning Quarto (`rap-docs\rap-learning.qmd`) to GitHub Pages at [scc-pi.github.io/community-knowledge-profiles](https://scc-pi.github.io/community-knowledge-profiles/) we used the public GitHub repo [quarto-dev/quarto-actions](https://github.com/quarto-dev/quarto-actions), In particular we followed the:

1. [Basic example](https://github.com/quarto-dev/quarto-actions/blob/main/examples/example-01-basics.md)  
    Added `quarto-publish.yml` to `.github\workflows`.

    i) We had to specify the .qmd file when doing the one time local `quarto publish` :  
        `quarto publish gh-pages rap-docs\rap-learning.qmd.qmd`  
      Otherwise we got an error like:  
          `ERROR: The specified path (C:\repo\community-knowledge-profiles) is not a website or book project so cannot be published.`  
    
    ii) Added a `.gitignore` file in `\rap-docs` with `*.html` to exclude local renderings.

1. [Non top level projects example](https://github.com/quarto-dev/quarto-actions/blob/main/examples/example-05-non-top-level.md)  
    Added `path: rap-docs` to our `quarto-publish.yml` file.

# Code Reviews

*TODO*

# Version Control

*TODO*

# Explore {renv} {#sec-explore-renv}

## Lock file

Our `renv.lock` file includes a lot of packages. We've not used {[renv](https://rstudio.github.io/renv/articles/renv.html)} before, so we need to check that the `renv.lock` file is right and that we're using {renv} correctly.

```{r}
#| label: renv-lock

# Convert the renv.lock json file to a data frame
renv_lock <- fromJSON(here("renv.lock"))$Packages |> 
  enframe() |> 
  as_tibble() |> 
  unnest_wider(value) |> 
  clean_names() |> 
  select(-name, -hash)

table_style(renv_lock)
```
 
|  
| There are `r nrow(renv_lock)` packages listed in our `renv.lock` file.
 
## Base R packages 

{renv} does not install or maintain your R version, it just makes a note of it in the `renv.lock` file.  

### All base packages  

What are the base packages for our `R.Version()`? Some base R packages are loaded on startup, other base packages need to be explicitly loaded.

```{r}
#| label: base-all

base_all <- rownames(installed.packages(priority = "base")) |> 
  as_tibble() |> 
  rename(package = value) |> 
  distinct() #FUDGE: duplicates packages when rendered via Quarto,
# but not when run interactively in RStudio

table_style(base_all)
```

|  
| There are `r nrow(base_all)` base R packages.  

### Loaded on startup

What are the base R packages loaded on startup? i.e. packages you do not need to explicitly load.  

```{r}
#| label: base-loaded

base_loaded <- c(getOption("defaultPackages"), "base") |> 
  as_tibble() |> 
  rename(package = value)

table_style(base_loaded, scroll_box = FALSE)
```

There are `r nrow(base_loaded)` base R packages loaded on startup.  


### Not loaded on startup  

What are the base R packages not loaded on startup? i.e. packages you may need to explicitly load. 

```{r}
#| label: base-not-loaded

base_not_loaded <- base_all |> 
  anti_join(base_loaded, by = "package")

table_style(base_not_loaded, scroll_box = FALSE)
```

There are `r nrow(base_not_loaded)` base R packages not loaded on startup.  

## Explicitly loaded  

Packages explicitly loaded from the library by scripts in this project.

```{r}
#| label: explicit

explicit <- dependencies(here(), progress = FALSE) |> 
  clean_names() |> 
  select(package, source)

table_style(explicit)
```

|  
| Unique list of packages, irrespective of whether the package has been called by multiple scripts.

```{r}
#| label: unique-explicit

unique_explicit <- explicit |> 
  select(package) |> 
  distinct()

table_style(unique_explicit)
```

|  
| There are `r nrow(unique_explicit)` packages explicitly loaded from the library by scripts in this project.  

## Implicitly loaded  

"Implicit" packages that the explicitly loaded packages depend upon.  

```{r}  
#| label: implicit

options(repos = c(CRAN = "https://cloud.r-project.org"))

# I think this makes a call to CRAN
implicit <- package_dependencies( 
  packages = pull(unique_explicit, package),
  recursive = TRUE
) |> 
  enframe() |> 
  as_tibble() |> 
  unnest_longer(value) |> 
  rename(explicit = name, implicit = value)

#options(repos = c(CRAN = "https://cloud.r-project.org"))

table_style(implicit)
```

|  
| Unique list of implicit packages.

```{r}
#| label: unique-implicit

# Exclude explicit and base R packages
unique_implicit <- implicit |> 
  select(implicit) |> 
  distinct() |> 
  anti_join(explicit, by = join_by(implicit == package)) |> 
  anti_join(base_all, by = join_by(implicit == package))

table_style(unique_implicit)
```

|  
| Excluding base R packages, there are `r nrow(unique_implicit)` packages required by library packages explicitly loaded by scripts in this project.  

## Conclusion  

The sum of explicit and implicit packages is `r nrow(unique_explicit) + nrow(unique_implicit)`. This compares with `r nrow(renv_lock)` packages listed in the `renv.lock` file. 

This is close enough.
